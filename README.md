[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/hvxahv/hvxahv)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/hvxahv/hvxahv) [![Go](https://github.com/hvxahv/hvxahv/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hvxahv/hvxahv/actions/workflows/lint.yml)

Currently, the first version of hvxahv is being implemented, and the current plan is to make the program work first, and then optimize the performance, so the current program code will be very confusing, please pay attention.

If you have any questions, please submit ISSUES.

Or enter the community discussion of the project: [Discussions hvxahv/community (github.com)](https://github.com/hvxahv/community/discussions)

## Next plans:

- In the process of implementation, the developer believes that the user's key and some personal sensitive data should not be stored in the server, even the instance custodian should not see it, so hvxahv is changing the design about user privacy.
- The current hvxahv does not represent the final design, the developers are pursuing the best solution for user privacy and security.
- The current hvxahv is under active development and cannot be used as any production environment for the time being. The source code will be modified or rewritten frequently, please pay attention.
- hvxahv's pursuit of privacy is the ultimate, please believe that the future hvxahv will become safe and reliable.

## A fully decentralized social network implementation, building an open source, free, decentralized open network.

A social platform based on the decentralized ActivityPub decentralized social network protocol, the ipfs distributed persistent storage protocol and the matrix.org real-time communication protocol, an open source decentralized social network with data really in its own hands.

1. Find and add your social network friends as easy as an email format (`name@domain`) address.
2. Cross-server content publishing channel (channel), the content cannot be deleted or modified.
3. Directly communicate end-to-end encrypted instant messaging with friends.
4. Direct end-to-end encrypted instant messaging with friends.

It is a platform for content publishing, social networking, and instant messaging. Anyone can build their own instance and design their own interface. Social communication is possible with all platforms that implement the ActivityPub protocol. Store broadcast channel data in the IPFS file system, persistent and non-deletable and unmodifiable. Can communicate with end-to-end encryption programs on all platforms that implement the Matrix.org protocol.
