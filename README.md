Disism - HALFMEMORIES

Currently, the first version is being implemented intensively, all we are doing is trying to get the program working first and then optimize it for performance, so please note that the code is very confusing at the moment.

If you have any questions, please submit them to ISSUES.

Or go to the project's community discussion: Discussions - [hvxahv/community](github.com)

## The next plan.
- Perfect Forward Secrecy In the process of enabling encryption in saved, a right way should be found to secure encrypted data, and Perfect Forward Secrecy is one of the next directions to be investigated.
- During the implementation, the developers believe that the user's keys and some personal sensitive data should not be stored in the server and should not be visible even to the instance host, so hvxahv is revamping the design regarding user privacy.
- The current hvxahv does not represent the final design, and the developers are pursuing the best solution for user privacy and security.
- Please note that the current version of hvxahv is under active development and cannot be used in any production environment at this time, and that the source code will be modified or rewritten on a regular basis.
- hvxahv puts privacy first, so trust that the future of hvxahv will be safe and secure.


## A fully decentralized social network implementation to build open source, free, decentralized open networks.

Based on the decentralized ActivityPub decentralized social network protocol, ipfs distributed persistent storage protocol and matrix.org real-time communication protocol social platform, an open source decentralized social network with data truly in your own hands.

1. like email format (`name@domain`) address as simple as finding and adding your social network friends , built on the ActivityPub protocol .
2. cross-server content distribution channel (channel), based on ipfs distributed persistent storage protocol .
3. end-to-end encrypted instant messaging directly with your friends, adding [matrix.org](http://matrix.org) protocol server. 4.
4. Encrypted cloud storage with unlimited space based on ipfs features.

It is a comprehensive, content publishing, social, instant messaging platform. Anyone can build their own instance and design their own interface.
