## Introduction

A decentralized social network implementation.

Based on the decentralized activitypub social protocol, the decentralized file system content publishing channel of the ipfs protocol, and the end-to-end encrypted instant messaging of the matrix.org protocol, an open source decentralized social network whose data is truly in your hands.

- Find and add your social network friends like an email address: `name@domain` .
- Find public channels across servers.
- Direct end-to-end encrypted instant messaging with your friends.
- They are all decentralized.

## Build an open source, decentralized open network.

It is a platform that integrates content publishing, social networking, and instant messaging.

Anyone can build their own examples and design their own interface.

It can communicate socially with all platforms that implement the Activitypub protocol.

Store the channel data in the ipfs file system.

It can communicate with all end-to-end encryption programs that implement the Matrix protocol.

## You can use it easily

#### Find your friends

Find and add your friends like email.

You only need to know the ID of the other party, that is, search for friends like an email format. `name@domain`, it is decentralized, you can find friends in any instance at will.

#### Find public channels.

Find public channels across servers. We focus on freedom of the press.

We provide a decentralized channel function. You can create or find content publishing channels that you are interested in. Its search is as simple as searching for the channel keywords of interest in the index channel. It is based on IPFS. Once After publishing, the content cannot be changed or deleted.

#### End-to-end encrypted communication.

Direct end-to-end encrypted communication with your friends. Protect your instant messaging privacy so that your chat information will not be known by a third person.

We have implemented a simple end-to-end encrypted chat program based on the matrix protocol, which simplifies the search function of other clients of the matrix, because you only need to click the friend chat in your address book, because the background has already done it for you For other necessary things, you can also manually add chat objects in other matrix clients, as long as you use the matrix format `@name:domain` to add friends and talk.
